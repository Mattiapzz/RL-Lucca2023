# Assignment 1

## 1.a

[add table with results]



What do you observe when the discount factor changes?


The value function takes longer to converge when the discount factor is closer to one. Additionally, when $\gamma = 1$ and we use policy $\pi_1$ the $(I-\gamma P_{ij}^{\pi(s)})$ is singular.

## 1.b

Are these policies optimal? 

Not necessarily, we are not guaranteed to find the optimal policy. ???

What do you observe when the discount factor changes?

The same consideration as in 1.a applies here.
